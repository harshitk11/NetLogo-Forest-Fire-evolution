# NetLogo-Forest-Fire-evolution
The code is used to model the evolution of forest fire using NetLogo (multi-agent modelling framework.)

To run the [code](forest_fire_evolution.nlogo), you will have to use the [NetLogo agent](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Agent-Based%20Model).

A high-level description of the model can be found [here](fire_evolution_dynamics_explained.PNG).

###### Future Work 
To make the model more realistic: (1) Implement realistic heat decay models. (2) Make *transfer_efficiency* a function of distance.
